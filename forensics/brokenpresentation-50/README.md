## Problem
I have data in this presentation but I can't see any of it. Can you recover anything?

## Hint
It's a PDF...

## Internal Notes
### Flag
pgctf{h1dd3n_stuff_doesnt_v4nish}

### Problem Notes
Open the PDF using *almost* any PDF editor (like Adobe Acrobat) and you can edit the artifacts placed in front of the flag. You can also use Adobe Illustrator, but most people won't have access to this tool since it's expensive.
