## Problem
This is a file. I know because of the way it is. But something is not right about the way it is.

## Hint
Bytes are not always as they seem.

## Internal Notes
### Flag
pgctf{r3v3rse_y0ur_p3rspective}

### Problem Notes
Create a program that returns the inverse of every byte. You'll get a zip file with the flag inside.
