## Problem
<!-- *** IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER ***
The Wireshark packet capture file we've chosen is a REAL data capture; the reason behind this choice is to educate participants on the tools of Wireshark and its ability to defend against threats. We have not screened the hundreds of thousands of packets to look for explicit content. By continuing to participate in this category, you are acknowledging that there may be explicit data. Furthermore, any emails, phone numbers, or any other points of contact are OUT OF SCOPE and it would be highly UNETHICAL to use these. -->
Welcome to the Wireshark exploration experience. None of the flags for this category are in flag format.
I noticed there is a lot of IRC traffic.
Your first task is to tell me what percent of the packets in this capture are IRC protocol (Rounded to the nearest tenth. Flag EX: 83.7)

## Hint
You are looking for statistics.

## Internal Notes
* Solution * 17.6
In Wireshark, go to Statistics > Protocol Hierarchy
