## Problem
What is the event number of the first IRC connection and the last IRC connection? (Flag EX: 12114-28784)

## Hint
There is a filter feature...

## Internal Notes
* Solution * 35748-54535
In the filter bar, use this expression: irc
Then, click on "No." in the main window to sort the list by event number.
